rsab
====

This Node module provides wrappers for the RSA public/private key
crypto functionality of OpenSSL.

This module was inspired by
[node-rsa](https://github.com/chrisa/node-rsa) by Chris Andrews,
though I (danfuzz) don't think there's any code remaining from that
implementation.

Installing
----------

```bash
npm install rsab
```
